        <li><strong><a id="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking">Stephen Hawking:</a></strong> CH CBE FRS FRSA (8 January 1942 – 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author, who
          was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge at the time of his death.He was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009.<br>His scientific works
          included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first to
          set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.</li><br clear="left">

        <li><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller"> Helen Keller:</a></strong> (June 27, 1880 – June 1, 1968) was an American author, political activist, and lecturer. She was the first deaf-blind person to earn a bachelor
          of arts degree.<br>The story of Keller and her teacher, Anne Sullivan, was made famous by Keller's autobiography, The Story of My Life, and its adaptations for film and stage, The Miracle Worker. Her birthplace in West Tuscumbia, Alabama, is
          now a museum[1] and sponsors an annual "Helen Keller Day". Her June 27 birthday is commemorated as Helen Keller Day in Pennsylvania and, in the centenary year of her birth, was recognized by a presidential proclamation from Jimmy Carter.</li>

          <li><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash_Jr.">John Forbes Nash Jr.:</a></strong> (June 13, 1928 – May 23, 2015) was an American mathematician who made fundamental contributions to game theory, differential
            geometry, and the study of partial differential equations.Nash's work has provided insight into the factors that govern chance and decision-making inside complex systems found in everyday life.<br>His theories are widely used in economics.
            Serving as a Senior Research Mathematician at Princeton University during the later part of his life, he shared the 1994 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with game theorists Reinhard Selten and John Harsanyi. In 2015, he also shared
            the Abel Prize with Louis Nirenberg for his work on nonlinear partial differential equations.</li><br clear="left">

            the Classical and Romantic eras in classical music, he remains one of the most recognised and influential of all composers. His best-known compositions include 9 symphonies; 5 piano concertos; 1 violin concerto; 32 piano sonatas; 16 string
            quartets; a mass, the Missa solemnis; and an opera, Fidelio.His career as a composer is conventionally divided into early, middle, and late periods; the "early" period is typically seen to last until 1802, the "middle" period from 1802 to
            1812, and the "late" period from 1812 to his death in 1827.</li><br clear="left">
